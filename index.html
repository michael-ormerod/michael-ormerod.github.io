        <h3>International Travel</h3>
        <p>I have consistently travelled overseas for work and pleasure since I was about 18 years old. I love visiting new places, exploring, meeting new people and taking on new challenges. What I love is that you leave everything behind in Australia and you have an entirel new focus whilst you are in a different country. Below I have created a table to provide you with a snapshot of my experiences to date!</p>
        <table>

                <td>In 2018 I had a short stop in England to visit one of my friends (and old roommate). We have known each other since 2012 and we still keep in regular contact.</td>

        <h3>CrossFit</h3>
            <p>I have always been someone who 'semi-regularly' goes to the gym and doesn't really get anywhere. One day, I came across one of my friends who was looking quite strong, muscular and fit. He mentioned to me that he did CrossFit and encourage me to give it a go. At the start of 2019, i decided to join a local box and I fell in love with the sport. I love every aspect to it, from the weightlifting, the gymnastics, the competitive scene but especially the Community support!</p>
        <h4>Olympic Lifting</h4>
            <p> Olympic ("Olly") lifting is probably my favourite. It is comprised of two movements known as a 'clean' and a 'snatch', both of which require a great deal of strength, balance, power and flexibility to master.</p>
