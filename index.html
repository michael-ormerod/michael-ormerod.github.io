        <h3>International Travel</h3>
        <p>I have consistently travelled overseas for work and pleasure since I was about 18 years old. I love visiting new places, exploring, meeting new people and taking on new challenges. What I love is that you leave everything behind in Australia and you have an entirel new focus whilst you are in a different country. Below I have created a table to provide you with a snapshot of my experiences to date!</p>

Their summer is more or less compared to our winter and it can be anywhere from 13 degrees to 25 degrees during the day, not to mention they have about 22 hours of daylight each day during summer! You may recognise this mountain is from Game of Thrones (North of the wall where the White Walkers come from)</td>

        <h3>CrossFit</h3>
            <p>I have always been someone who 'semi-regularly' goes to the gym and doesn't really get anywhere. One day, I came across one of my friends who was looking quite strong, muscular and fit. He mentioned to me that he did CrossFit and encourage me to give it a go. At the start of 2019, i decided to join a local box and I fell in love with the sport. I love every aspect to it, from the weightlifting, the gymnastics, the competitive scene but especially the Community support!</p>
        <h4>Olympic Lifting</h4>
            <p> Olympic ("Olly") lifting is probably my favourite. It is comprised of two movements known as a 'clean' and a 'snatch', both of which require a great deal of strength, balance, power and flexibility to master.</p>
